      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using YTJudolRemover, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations.
        Your use of the Service constitutes your acknowledgment that you have read, understood, and agreed to be legally

      <h2>2. Use of Service</h2>
      <p>
        YTJudolRemover is developed by the CodeNova Team to detect and manage ‚Äújudol‚Äù comments (provocative, misleading,
        or irrelevant content) on YouTube videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may input a YouTube video link‚Äîeither their own or someone else‚Äôs‚Äîto analyze the comment section. If the
        video belongs to the user, the Service may offer options to hide or manage disruptive comments. If the video does
        not belong to the user, the Service allows the user to report such comments as spam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may manually review, approve, or ignore detected comments, giving them full control and flexibility.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The application is strictly limited to this purpose. We do not and will not use the collected data for any unrelated,
        unauthorized, or malicious activities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-collection-and-use">
      <h2>3. Data Collection & Use</h2>
      <p>
        YTJudolRemover utilizes the YouTube Data API v3 to authenticate users and access their YouTube account data for
        the sole purpose of enabling comment analysis and moderation features.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticate the user via OAuth</li>
        <li>Retrieve video and comment data for moderation</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        No personal data is permanently stored, shared, or sold. CodeNova Team guarantees responsible use of user data and does not engage in any misuse or unethical manipulation of account information.
